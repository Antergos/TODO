## v0.8 Development Cycle

### General:
 - [ ] Check if we can remove subprocess calls to pythonian code
 - [x] Encrypt home directory (needs testing)
 - [ ] Revamp the UI with a minimal, flat design.
 - [ ] Fix empty space at the bottom of some screens.
 - [ ] Get aria2 working in download.py so we have more control over any failures.

### Advanced Install:
 - [ ] If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.
 - [ ] Add LVM support (create / delete)
 - [ ] Add btrfs subvolume support
 - [ ] Add RAID support

### Slides screen:
 - [ ] Redo ALL slides
 - [ ] Remove popup (install completed) and add a message inside the slides screen instead.

### Alongside Install:
 - [ ] Rethink and redo this option. Doesn't work as it is.

 
And much more... (see issues in github)
