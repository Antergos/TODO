 - [ ] Fix empty space at the bottom of some screens.
 - [ ] Get aria2 working in download.py so we have more control over any failures.

### Advanced Install:
 - [ ] If you play with the partitioner (create partition, delete it, create it
   again, delete it again...) in the end it gets confused.
 - [ ] Add LVM support (create / delete)

### Slides screen:

And much more... (see issues in github)
